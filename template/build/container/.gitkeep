# This folder should be used for containers
#
# If there are multiple containers for a service (such as containers with the sidecar pattern and so fourth), create
# multiple subdirectories
#
# However, multiple containers are an anti-pattern. If a container can be reused across multiple different projects
# establish it with a separate lifecycle in a separate repository
